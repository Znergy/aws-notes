# AWS Notes
###### This repo contains the notes I've taken as I've learned more about AWS. I figured someone else could get some benefit out of my hours of research, and learn with me as I come across new concepts and services with AWS.

## About Me
* I'm currently spending two nights a week for four hours going through cloud guru videos, and it's a ton of information. I'm also using my free time to take AWS Udemy courses and watch relevant YouTube videos on varying AWS services.

## Future Notes
* I plan on continously updating this repo as I gain more and more knowledge so feel free to star the repo and check back frequently for updated notes.

## Contact
* To get in touch with me for whatever reason, please email me at ryanjonesirl@gmail.com
